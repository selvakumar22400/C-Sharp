 What is Common Language Runtime (CLR)?
      CLR handles program execution for various languages including C#. 
      The architecture of CLR handles memory management, garbage collection, security handling
      
What is garbage collection in C#?
      Garbage collection is the process of freeing up memory that is captured by unwanted objects.
      When you create a class object, automatically some memory space is allocated to the object in the heap memory.
      Now, after you perform all the actions on the object, the memory space occupied by the object becomes waste. 
      It is necessary to free up memory  
 
 What are indexers in C# .NET?   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-sharp-indexers/
      Indexers are known as smart arrays in C#. 
      It allows the instances of a class to be indexed in the same way as an array.
      
      [access_modifier] [return_type] this [argument_list]
      {
        get 
        {
           // get block code
        }
        set 
        {
          // set block code
        }

      }
      //it is simlier to the propertiy
      
What are the types of classes in C#?
    Abstract class
    Partial class
    Sealed class
    Static class      
    
What is the difference between C# abstract class and an interface?
   absract    It contains both declaration and definition parts.
              A class can only use one abstract class.
              The performance of an abstract class is fast.

   interface  It contains only a declaration part.
              A class can use multiple interfaces.
              The performance of the interface is slow
              
What are extension methods in C#?  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/extension-method-in-c-sharp/
   In C#, the extension method concept allows you to add new methods in the existing class  
   
    // Method 5
    public static void M5(this Geek g, string str)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(str);
    }
    
What is inheritance? Does C# support multiple inheritance?
   c# inheritance allows using the perent class features in child class
    
    But C# does not support multiple class inheritance.
    To overcome this problem we use interfaces to achieve multiple class inheritance.

 What is a managed and unmanaged code?
    Managed code lets you run the code on a managed CLR runtime environment in the .NET framework. 
    Managed code runs on the managed runtime environment than the operating system itself. 
    Benefits: Provides various services like a garbage collector, exception handling, etc. 

    Unmanaged code is when the code doesn’t run on CLR, it is an unmanaged code that works outside the .NET framework. 
    They don’t provide services of the high-level languages and therefore, run without them. Such an example is C++
  
what is enum ?
    An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable/read-only variables).
    To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the enum items with a comma:  
    You can access enum items with the dot syntax
    enum Level 
    {
      Low,
      Medium,
      High
    }
    Level myVar = Level.Medium;
    Console.WriteLine(myVar);
